Project Proposal: Our project is to uncover patterns in voter registration across the United States. We'll examine relationships between educational attainment, income, location of residence, and tenure at residence and their potential impacts on voter registration.

Questions for our project will be:
Does educational attainment impact voter registration rates?
Does socioeconomic status impact voter registration rates?
 3. Does geographic location impact voter registration rates?
 4. Does tenure at residence impact voter registration rates?

All data will be taken from the census information provided by the United States Census Bureau specifically from the 2016 Presidential Election datasets.
Dataset 1: Reported Voting and Registration, by Age, Sex, and Educational Attainment: November 2016
Dataset 2: Reported Voting and Registration, by Age, for the United States, Regions, and Divisions: November 2016
Dataset 3: Reported Voting and Registration of Family Members, by Age and Family Income: November 2016
Dataset 4: Reported Voting and Registration, by Duration of Residence, and Tenure: November 2016 (All races)
